Sam’s Quick English Tips
Sam wanted to learn English fast, so he followed a few tips his teacher suggested.
First, he practiced ending sounds. He read words like books, lessons, and friends, and noticed that the little “s” sound made his speech clearer. Then he tried past tense. He said worked, played, and wanted. He realized “-ed” endings sounded different but still mattered.
His teacher said, “Don’t worry, it gets easier when you listen.”
Sam also learned about the American T. He noticed how water, better, and city sounded softer, almost like “d.” He started linking up words: going to read it, want to try it.
He told himself, “I’m not going to quit. I’ll keep practicing every day.”
And little by little, Sam’s English skills improved—he watched shows, asked questions, and smiled when people said, “Hey, you sound better now!”
